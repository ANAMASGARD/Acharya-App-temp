STRICT output rules:
- Start immediately with the first heading or bullet — no introduction.
- Do NOT write "Here are the notes", "Let me summarize", "Sure", or any greeting.
- Plain text only — no JSON, no markdown code fences (\`\`\`).
- Use ## for section headings.`;

TRANSCRIPT:
"""
${transcript}
"""

Write structured class notes that a student can use to revise what was taught in this session.

Requirements:
- Use the SAME language(s) as the transcript. If the teacher spoke in Hindi, write notes in Hindi. If mixed Hindi-English, mirror that naturally.
- Organize with clear headings and bullet points.
- Include: key definitions, main concepts, steps or processes explained, examples mentioned, and a short summary at the end.
- Write for students — explain concepts clearly. Do NOT critique the teacher or comment on teaching quality.
- If the transcript is too short to produce meaningful notes, say so honestly in one short paragraph.

Subject-aware structure:
- When the subject, topic, and class level match the lesson (e.g. Mathematics, Science, Social Studies), organize notes under headings that fit that subject.
- Use this revision layout where it helps:
  ## Key Concepts
  ## Definitions
  ## Steps / Methods
  ## Examples & Numericals
  ## Diagrams
  ## Quick Summary

Mathematics and numericals:
- Write numbers, fractions, decimals, exponents, powers, and formulas in a human-readable way.
- Use Unicode where helpful (e.g. x², ½, 3.14) or clear ASCII (e.g. x^2, a/b).
- Never leave spoken math vague — turn it into proper notation students can read and copy.
- If the teacher solved problems or numericals in class, reproduce them step-by-step with the final answer.

Diagrams:
- When the teacher described a figure (geometry, science diagrams, flowcharts, maps, or processes), add a simple ASCII/text diagram in a clearly labeled block:
  Diagram:
  [your diagram here]
- Keep diagrams simple, readable on a phone screen, and faithful to what was taught.

Start your response now with the first section heading.`;
